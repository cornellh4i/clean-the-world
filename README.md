# MERN Starter

This repository provides an opinionated, pre-configured project setup for a MERN webapp's frontend and backend components.

The frontend and backend both make use of TypeScript, and the repository comes pre-packaged with testing, continuous integration workflows, auto-PR requesting (CODEOWNERS), and a PR template

The frontend and backend repos each have a README to help you get started with the project.

To get started, either fork this repo or clone using `git clone https://github.com/Archit404Error/MERN-webapp`
