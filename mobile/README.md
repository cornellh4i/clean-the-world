# Mobile TS Frontend
## Getting Started
Start off by running `yarn install` to add all dependencies (install yarn if you don't already have it on your computer. On MacOS you can do this with `brew install yarn`)

Simply run `yarn start` to start running metro bundler -- download the expo go app on your phone and scan the QR code that appears in your terminal.

Alternatively, you can run `yarn ios` or `yarn android` to open the iOS simulator or Android emulator, respectively (can also do this via `yarn start` then pressing 'i' or 'a', respectively).
